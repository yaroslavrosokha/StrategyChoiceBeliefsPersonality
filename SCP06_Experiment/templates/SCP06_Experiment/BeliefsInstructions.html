        <p>
            Before we implement your plan in Match #{{ player.round_number }}, <strong style="font-weight: bold;color: blue;">on the next screen we will
            ask you what you think the chances are that the other participant chooses each of the ten plans.</strong><br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            In other words, we will ask you  how many times out of 100 you think the other participant
            in Match #{{ player.round_number }} would choose each of the ten plans.<br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            Of course, the other participant chooses his/her plan for Match #{{ player.round_number }}
            only once (just like you), not 100 times. But you can think of the question as a way of
            asking how likely the other participant is to choose each of the plans.<br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            You will be paid according to the accuracy of your answer.
            <u>You will make the most money on average if you answer truthfully what you think the chances
        are that the other participant chooses each of the plans.</u><br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            You will not be paid for your answer until the end of the experiment.
            Your answer will not be shown to any other participant. Your answer will not affect the experiment in any way.<br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            You do not need to understand the details of how the payment works.
            If you are interested, the details follow below. If you are not interested,
            you can stop reading this screen now.<br/>
        </p>

        <p><i>Details of how the payment works:<br/></p>
        <p style="left: 5%;width: 90%;position: relative;">
            For this task, you start with 400 points and you will then be penalized for inaccuracy.
            The total penalty can never be more than 400 points.
            Your payment for this task will be 400 points minus the total penalty.<br/><br/>

            For each of the ten possible plans, the penalty will be calculated as follows.<br/>
            <ol style="left: 5%;width: 90%;position: relative;">
            <li>If that plan is chosen by the other participant, then the penalty will be
            smaller the higher your answer about the chances that the other participant
            chooses that plan. In that case, the penalty is calculated as follows:<br/>

                <p align="center">(100 &minus; Your Answer) &times; (100 &minus; Your Answer) &times; (0.02 points)</p></li>

            <li>If that plan is not chosen by the other participant,
            then the penalty will be smaller the lower your answer about the chances
            that the other participant chooses that plan. In that case,
            the penalty is calculated as follows:<br/>

                <p align="center">(Your Answer) &times; (Your Answer) &times; (0.02 points)</p></li>
            </ol>
